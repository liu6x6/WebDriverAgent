# POC of adding a Video server on WebDriverAgent
this is a POC of adding a h264 stream on the WebDriverAgent.
using apple video toolbox to generate the h264 stream

the tcp video server is on port 10001

better to use iproxy to access that tcp port

using (iosplayer)[https://github.com/liu6x6/iosplayer] to play it


## use websocket
use node js will be very easy to test it

use (AAC)[https://github.com/liu6x6/aac]
